Pad Thai – Classic Thai Stir-Fried Noodles
Description

Pad Thai is Thailand’s most famous street-food dish: rice noodles stir-fried with a sweet-sour-savory sauce made from tamarind, fish sauce, and palm sugar, tossed with egg, tofu or shrimp, and finished with crunchy peanuts and fresh lime. The balance of flavors is key—no single taste should dominate.

Ingredients (serves 2–3)
Noodles & Proteins

200 g (7 oz) flat rice noodles

150 g (5 oz) shrimp, peeled & deveined
(or chicken, tofu, or a mix)

100 g (3.5 oz) firm tofu, diced

2 eggs

2 tbsp vegetable oil

Pad Thai Sauce

3 tbsp tamarind paste

2 tbsp fish sauce

1½ tbsp palm sugar (or brown sugar)

1 tsp soy sauce (optional, for depth)

½–1 tsp chili flakes (optional)

Vegetables & Garnish

2 cloves garlic, minced

2 cups bean sprouts

3 spring onions, cut into 5 cm pieces

3 tbsp roasted peanuts, crushed

Lime wedges

Optional: extra chili flakes

Necessary Steps

Soak the noodles
Place rice noodles in warm water for 20–30 minutes until pliable but not soft. Drain well.

Make the sauce
In a bowl, mix tamarind paste, fish sauce, palm sugar, soy sauce, and chili flakes. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Taste: it should be tangy, slightly sweet, and savory.

Stir-fry the protein
Heat oil in a wok or large pan over high heat. Add shrimp and cook until just pink. Remove and set aside.

Cook aromatics & tofu
Add garlic and tofu to the pan. Stir-fry until fragrant and lightly golden.

Add eggs
Push everything to one side, crack in the eggs, scramble briefly, then mix into the tofu.

Add noodles & sauce
Add drained noodles and pour in the sauce. Toss quickly, letting the noodles absorb the liquid. Add a splash of water if needed.

Combine & finish
Return shrimp to the pan. Add bean sprouts and spring onions. Toss for 30–60 seconds—vegetables should stay crisp.

Serve
Plate immediately and top with crushed peanuts, chili flakes, and lime wedges.

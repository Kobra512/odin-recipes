    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spätzle is a type of pasta dish famous in southern Germany and Austria. They are way more fluffy than ordinary italian pasta and are almost always made completely fresh. There are different methods for forming the raw dough into the typical shape, which is either</p>
    <ul>
      <li>little droplets of dough</li>
      <li>longer noodles of dough, similar to Udon noodles</li>
    </ul>
    For the former you'll need a special kind of kitchen utensil called a &ldquo;Spätzlehobel&rdquo; which might be really difficult to get your hands on, depending on where you live.
    <p>The latter is achieved by putting the flat dough on a board over the boiling water and getting pieces of the dough inside the pot with a kind of cutting-scraping movement. You can get a general idea by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTXIbjbOVBQ"> this short video</a></p>
